\dropcap{A}{ccurate}, efficient and high-resolution methods of surface water detection are needed to develop a better water management \st{policy}, provide input for hydrological and hydraulic models. \st{, and to deal with a plethora of satellite information becoming available for a steadily growing number of users}. \mycomment[JS]{The amount of data is unrelated to the first part of the scentence} Monitoring of surface water extent and dynamics is essential for a better understanding of natural processes, anthropogenic factors as well as climate change. \mycomment[JS]{MAybe somethin glike this?: This is becoming more important because Water resources are under pressure from economic sectors such as industry, agriculture, energy, tourism as well as domestic use. Furthermore, water availability is decreasing,  driving more regions into water insecurity [1]VN, UN-Water report Monitoring: Mapping Existing Global Systems & Initiatives â€“ Background document, 2006 [2] McDonald, R. I., et.al.. (2012). Urban growth, climate change, and freshwater availability. PNAS 108(15), 6312-6317.}

Recent international agendas on climate change and environment demand objective information on planetary land and water surface conditions and changes, to be able to study the drivers behind them. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (GSDs) \mycomment[JS]{refer to http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&Lang=E} define seventeen challenges to be achieved by 2030, and almost half of them will directly or indirectly require up to date and high-resolution information on surface water. To name some, sustainable management \st{of} for water and its use for food production, the role of the surface water for the spreading of deceases, climate change, and many other. 

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the Technical Paper VI on Climate Change and Water defines knowledge gaps in observations and our understanding of the behavior of water. Moreover, with the variety and volumes of Earth Observation (EO) data available today, these gaps frequently mean the lack of proper algorithms to process existing data. The raw data need to be processed properly to derive higher level variables easily interpretable by broader, frequently non-academic, community. 

\mycomment[JS]{I would revisit this once the rest is done and zoom in on the significance of you work (it is!). You can start at the SDG, show how water resources are declining and how important it is to accurately know where water is at high resolution.. Something along those lines}


\section{Research Questions}

\mycomment[JS]{This is a key section. Make this simple and top the point}
Many attempts have been made during the last decade to establish global scale surface water coverage and occurrence \mycomment[JS]{if you state this you also need to provide refs!}, but most of the studies so far were limited in spatial or temporal resolution, and accuracy. \st{Furthermore, numerous studies were performed to analyze surface water dynamics globally.} \st{ Still, many questions remain open, and the most important one is the lack of our understanding of how the surface water has been changing during the last decades, where EO data are available? }. \mycomment[JS]{No idea how to reformulate this but is read rather difficult } To answer this \st{bigger} question, the following questions need to be answered to address issues of global objectivity, accuracy, global applicability, and access by non-experts:\mycomment[JS]{Non experts????? why? } 

\mycomment[JS]{Now we are getting to the point. I would rewrite the above to be an introduction to these points. Now is seems like an extension of the previous section.... What you list below are the points you deal with in your thesis but they are not properly introduced (from literature)}
What are limits in automated surface water detection methods, where no manual tuning is required?

How to deal with typical issues if you wish to do automated classification, accounting for clouds, hill shadows, snow/ice and mixed urban and rural areas?

How to extract the maximum information from very noisy images, where surface water can be partially visible?

How to upscale methods to the global scale?

How to streamline the use of satellite images measured from different passive optical and active radar satellite sensors and what observation frequency can be achieved in this case? 

How to put these analysis methods in the hands of stakeholders so that they can tailor their analysis to their needs and area of interest?

These are the central questions addressed \st {here} in this thesis.

Even though most of the methods developed during this research were applied to process multispectral satellite imagery, some of them are also applicable to process other types of imagery, such as backscatter information generated by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors.
\mycomment[JS]{Good paragraph but is seems a bit lost and out of place here...}

\section{Contributions}

The contributions can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A new method ($M_1$) for accurate \textbf{surface water} detection is developed, based on local thresholding of spectral indices computed from multispectral satellite datasets. The method is demonstrated to perform better than existing methods to discriminate surface water from noisy satellite images. The limitations and the prospects are discussed.
	
	\item A probabilistic method ($M_2$) in developed to \textbf{reconstruct surface water} from satellite images where surface water is only partially observed (due to limited swath, atmospheric noise or snow/ice cover). It is shown that the new method can be used to provide accurate estimates of reservoir surface water area from noisy satellite images.
	
	\item A statistical-based method ($M_3$) was developed to estimate global-scale \textbf{surface water changes} from medium-resolution multitemporal and multispectral satellite data. The method was applied to process more than a petabyte of Landsat data to identify surface water changes globally.
	
	\item An in-depth \textbf{small reservoir study} was conducted, aiming at the reconstruction of surface water area dynamics from satellite data. Here, we make use of the above two methods ($M_1$ and $M_2$)  to process satellite data from multiple passive multispectral optical and radar sensors (Landsat, ASTER, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1). The resulting water masks were validated against high-frequently in-situ water level observations. A very high correlation was obtained for both cloud-free and noisy images. 
	
	\item To address global water challenges, the first time planetary-scale analysis of three decades of satellite images is performed, quantifying Earth's surface water changes at the 30m spatial resolution and occurring during the last three decades. Two areas are identified to provide the largest contribution regarding surface water gains (Tibetan Plateau) and loses (Aral Sea). The results of the study are made freely available in the form of a website (\url{http://aqua-monitor.deltares.nl}) with the help of parallel satellite data processing platform Google Earth Engine. The study is performed by applying method $M_3$.
	
	\item Additionally, the same study analyzes surface water changes along the 40km coastal buffer zone globally. Chinese coast was identified as the largest contributor to coastal changes, when aggregated by country, mainly due to the land-reclamation projects.
	
	\begin{comment}
	\item The first 30m, nearly-global HAND dataset was developed, derived from NASA/USGS Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model and HydroBASINS dataset (\url{http://global-hand.appspot.com}). A homogenized, equal-size version of HydroBASINS dataset was generated to support parallel delineation of the drainage network, drainage directions and flow accumulation to generate global HAND dataset. We discuss the applicability of HAND and other hydrological datasets as auxiliary data to improve surface water detection in topographically challenging areas. We discuss the value of HAND dataset to identify errors in SRTM and its use for water classification in topographically complex areas. 
	\end{comment}
	
	\item Permanent surface water mask for Murray-Darling basin is estimated using the method $M_1$, Height Above the Nearest Drainage (HAND), and supervised classification for topographically difficult areas. The resulting surface water mask is made available for inspection in the form of a website (\url{http://osm-water.appspot.com}). The water mask developed for Murray-Darling River Basin was compared to the surface water vector dataset extracted from OpenStreetMap dataset and potential water mask derived from the 30m digital elevation model (SRTM). The positional accuracy of the rivers is estimated for three river datasets, and the results are discussed with regards to overall surface water coverage and positional differences.    
\end{itemize}

The algorithms presented in this research were successfully applied to develop various surface water datasets and software tools, allowing more accurate detection of surface water and contributing to a better understanding of the Earth's surface water extent and dynamics.

A crucial aspect is also related to simplicity and reproducibility of the methods so they can be easily extended to new datasets and will optimally use existing technical infrastructure. In the present research, all of the methods are shared with the community with a very permissive license, to ensure it can be easily reused and extended.

\section{Outline}

\dropcap{T}{he} thesis is organized as follows. Chapter \ref{ch1} reviews the relevant literature and existing methods used to detect surface water from freely-available multispectral satellite sensors. Additionally, it mentions Google Earth Engine - a parallel processing platform used to perform most of the analysis used for this research. The results discussed in the present thesis would be impossible to achieve without the adoption of this platform, which revolutionized satellite data processing, enabling planetary scale analysis for remote sensing researchers around the world.

The next four chapters focus on the development of new methods for automated surface water detection. Chapter \ref{ch2} studies in details various issues related to surface water detection. Here, the method $M_1$ is introduced, based on Canny edge detector and Otsu thresholding to allow very accurate detection of surface water. 

We will see how surface water can be detected very accurately even for very noisy images. The method is validated using in-situ data available for Prosser Creek Reservoir - a small reservoir in California, USA. The method is also further extended to process images from multiple passive sensor multispectral satellite missions: Landsat 4, Landsat 5, Landsat 7, Landsat 8, ASTER, and Sentinel-2. It is then also applied to process synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1. We will also construct a simple regression model using the highest quality cloud-free images, which will be used to evaluate method performance in Chapter \ref{ch3}. 

Chapter \ref{ch3} focuses on the use of probabilistic methods to further improve surface water area estimates ($M_2$). Here we will see how surface water mask can be reconstructed even with a small number of noisy-free pixels available. This is achieved by a two-step approach, where during the first step, a high-resolution bivariate probability density function is constructed from cloud-free only images. Then, a method is developed to infer the final surface water mask from the partially-observed water masks. We also validate the results by comparing it to the model constructed in the previous Chapter, to demonstrate that the method performance is improved.

In the next Chapter \ref{ch4}, a simple, yet powerful method ($M_3$) will be introduced to analyze long-term surface water changes from a long series of images using statistical. We will see how a simple surface reflectance percentile composites and linear regression can be used to detect surface water changes and how they can be distinguished from other processes, such as cloud cover or snow. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows to significantly speed-up parallel processing while preserving information about surface water changes. The method was then applied to process about 1.5 petabytes of the images from medium resolution (<30m) Landsat sensors. The results of the study are also summarized in the form of surface water changes aggregated per river basin globally, as well as along the coastline, aggregated per country.

The next Chapter \ref{ch7} demonstrates the use of the methods developed in Chapter \ref{ch2} to derive permanent surface water mask for 2013-2015 for Murray-Darling River Basin in Australia. Three surface water masks will be compared, derived from three different alternative sources: 30m multispectral satellite imagery (Landsat 8), OpenStreetMap and SRTM. Here, a stepwise approach to detect permanent surface water from percentile composite images will be applied to analyze images measured by Landsat 8 mission. We will also see how HAND dataset can be used as a topographic mask to detect mountainous areas where commission error of surface water detection is present. The resulting water mask is then refined using a supervised classification method based on classification and regression trees (CART), to perform the final clean-up of the dataset.

Concluding, in the last Chapter \ref{ch8-conclusion} summarized the main findings, existing challenges and trends related to methods of surface water detection as well as to the Earth Observation (EO) in general.
