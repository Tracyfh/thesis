\begin{enumerate}

\item Globally applicable, locally accurate and efficient surface water change detection methods are easier to implement than reported in the literature.
\citat{this thesis}

\item Aral Sea and Tibetan Plateau are the largest contributors to global surface water changes over the last three decades. \\
\citat{this thesis}

\item A combination of discriminative and generative methods for surface water detection is superior to a discriminative method only. \\
\citat{this thesis}

%\item Combining EO data with VGI provides more value when compared to the use of one of these types of data separately. \\
%\citat{this thesis}

\item Humankind is reclaiming land faster than the rising seas inundate. \\
\citat{this thesis}

\item Tractability and scalability are more important than accuracy and correctness. \\

\item By moving all Earth Observation data and the processing to the Cloud we significantly reduce their explorability. \\

\item In five years, many Earth Observation scientists will have to learn how to process videos to do their research. \\

\item With the annual growth in online data of zettabytes per year, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning are indispensable tools to gain new value from historical data. \\

\item Perfection is a subjective illusion.
