Since the quality of OSM data can vary strongly, different aspects have been investigated in several scientific studies. In most cases the data is compared with commercial or administrative datasets which, however, are not always accessible due to the lack of availability, contradictory licensing restrictions or high procurement costs. In this investigation a framework containing more than 25 methods and indicators is presented, allowing OSM quality assessments based solely on the data's history. Without the usage of a reference data set, approximate statements on OSM data quality are possible. For this purpose existing methods are taken up, developed further, and integrated into an extensible open source framework. This enables arbitrarily repeatable intrinsic OSM quality analyses for any part of the world.},

Hydrological sub-models of varying complexity are now part of global climate models, of models calculating global terrestrial carbon sequestration, of earth system models and even of integrated assessment models. This paper reviews the current state of global hydrological modeling, discusses past and recent developments and extrapolates these to future challenges and directions. First, established domains of global hydrological model applications are discussed, in terms of societal and science questions posed, the type of models developed and recent advances therein. Next, a genealogy of global hydrological models is given. After reviewing recent efforts to connect model components from different domains, new domains are identified where global hydrology is now starting to become an integral part of the analyses. Finally, inspired by these new domains of application, persistent and emerging challenges are identified as well as the directions global hydrology is likely to take in the coming decade and beyond.

  abstract = {Multipurpose small reservoirs are important for livelihoods in rural semi-arid regions. To manage and plan these reservoirs and to assess their hydrological impact at a river basin scale, it is important to monitor their water storage dynamics. This paper introduces a Bayesian approach for monitoring small reservoirs with radar satellite images. The newly developed growing Bayesian classifier has a high degree of automation, can readily be extended with auxiliary information and reduces the confusion error to the land-water boundary pixels. A case study has been performed in the Upper East Region of Ghana, based on Radarsat-2 data from November 2012 until April 2013. Results show that the growing Bayesian classifier can deal with the spatial and temporal variability in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter intensities from small reservoirs. Due to its ability to incorporate auxiliary information, the algorithm is able to delineate open water from SAR imagery with a low land-water contrast in the case of wind-induced Bragg scattering or limited vegetation on the land surrounding a small reservoir.},

  abstract = {The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely used for remote sensing of vegetation for many years. This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel around 0.66 ??m and a near-IR channel around 0.86 ??m. The red channel is located in the strong chlorophyll absorption region, while the near-IR channel is located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. The two channels sense very different depths through vegetation canopies. In this article, another index, namely the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is proposed for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space. NDWI is defined as (p(0.86 ??m) - ??(1.24 ??m))/(??(0.86 ??m) + ??(1.24 ??m)), where ?? represents the radiance in reflectance units. Both the 0.86-??m and the 1.24-??m channels are located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. Absorption by vegetation liquid water near 0.86 ??m is negligible. Weak liquid absorption at 1.24 ??m is present. Canopy scattering enhances the water absorption. As a result, NDWI is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies. Atmospheric aerosol scattering effects in the 0.86-1.24 ??m region are weak. NDWI is less sensitive to atmospheric effects than NDVI. NDWI does not remove completely the background soil reflectance effects, similar to NDVI. Because the information about vegetation canopies contained in the 1.24-??m channel is very different from that contained in the red channel near 0.66 ??m. NDWI should be considered as an independent vegetation index. It is complementary to, not a substitute for NDVI. Laboratory-measured reflectance of stacked green leaves, and spectral imaging data acquired with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over Jasper Ridge in California and the High Plains in northern Colorado, are used to demonstrate the usefulness of NDWI. Comparisons between NDWI and NDVI images are also given.},

The OpenStreetMap project is currently the most significant example of a system based on VGI. It aims at producing free vector geographic databases using contributions from Internet users. Spatial data quality becomes a key consideration in this context of freely downloadable geographic databases. This article studies the quality of French OpenStreetMap data. It extends the work of Haklay to France, provides a larger set of spatial data quality element assessments (i.e. geometric, attribute, semantic and temporal accuracy, logical con- sistency, completeness, lineage, and usage), and uses different methods of quality control. The outcome of the study raises questions such as the heterogeneity of processes, scales of production, and the compliance to standardized and accepted specifications. In order to improve data quality, a balance has to be struck between the contributors' freedom and their respect of specifications. The development of appropriate solutions to provide this balance is an important research issue in the domain of user-generated content.},

We show that useful estimates of absolute river discharge (in cubic meters per second) may be derived solely from satellite images, with no ground-based or a priori information whatsoever. The approach works owing to discovery of a characteristic scaling law uniquely fundamental to natural rivers, here termed a river's at-many-stations hydraulic geometry. A first demonstration using Landsat Thematic Mapper images over three rivers in the United States, Canada, and China yields absolute discharges agreeing to within 20-30{\%} of traditional in situ gauging station measurements and good tracking of flow changes over time. Within such accuracies, the door appears open for quantifying river resources globally with repeat imaging, both retroactively and henceforth into the future, with strong implications for water resource management, food security, ecosystem studies, flood forecasting, and geopolitics.},

  abstract = {Within the framework of Web 2.0 mapping applications, the most striking example of a geographical application is the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. OSM aims to create a free digital map of the world and is implemented through the engagement of participants in a mode similar to software development in Open Source projects. The information is collected by many participants, collated on a central database, and distributed in multiple digital formats through the World Wide Web. This type of information was termed 'Volunteered Geographical Information' (VG!) by Goodchild, 2007. However, to date there has been no systematic analysis of the quality of VGI. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing OSM information. The examination focuses on analysis of its quality through a comparison with Ordnance Survey (OS) datasets. The analysis focuses on London and England, since OSM started in London in August 2004 and therefore the study of these geographies provides the best understanding of the achievements and difficulties of VGI. The analysis shows that OSM information can be fairly accurate: on average within about 6 m of the position recorded by the OS, and with approximately 80{\%} overlap of motorway objects between the two datasets. In the space of four years, OSM has captured about 29{\%} of the area of England, of which approximately 24{\%} are digitised lines without a complete set of attributes. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings to the study of VGI as well as suggesting future research directions.},

The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms.

  abstract = {The normalized difference water index (NDWI) has been successfully used to delineate surface water features. However, two major problems have been often encountered: (a) NDWIs calculated from different band combinations [visible, nearinfrared, or shortwave-infrared (SWIR)] can generate different results, and (b) NDWIthresholds vary depending on the proportions of subpixel water/non-water components. We need to evaluate all the NDWIs for determining the best performing index and to establish appropriate thresholds for clearly identifying water features. We used the spectral data obtained from a spectral library to simulate the satellite sensors Landsat ETM, SPOT-5, ASTER,and MODIS,and calculated the simulated NDWIin different forms. We found that the NDWIcalculated from (green ? SWIR)/(green SWIR), where SWIRis the shorter wavelength region (1.2 to 1.8 mm), has the most stable threshold. We recommend this NDWIbe employed for mapping water, but adjustment of the threshold based on actual situations is necessary},

  abstract = {To study the Earth system and to better understand the implications of global environmental change, there is a growing need for large-scale hydrographic data sets that serve as prerequisites in a variety of analyses and applications, ranging from regional watershed and freshwater conservation planning to global hydrological, climate, biogeochemical, and land surface modeling. Yet while countless hydrographic maps exist for well-known river basins and individual nations, there is a lack of seamless high-quality data on large scales such as continents or the entire globe. Data for many large international basins are patchy, and remote areas are often poorly mapped.In response to these limitations, a team of scientists has developed data and created maps of the world's rivers that provide the research community with more reliable information about where streams and watersheds occur on the Earth's surface and how water drains the landscape. The new product, known as HydroSHEDS (Hydrological Data and Maps Based on Shuttle Elevation Derivatives at Multiple Scales), provides this information at a resolution and quality unachieved by previous global data sets, such as HYDRO1k [U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), 2000].},

  abstract = {Remote sensing has more advantages than the traditional methods of land surface water (LSW) mapping because it is a low-cost, reliable information source that is capable of making high-frequency and repeatable observations. The normalized difference water indexes (NDWIs), calculated from various band combinations (green, near-infrared (NIR), or shortwave-infrared (SWIR)), have been successfully applied to LSW mapping. $\backslash$r$\backslash$nIn fact, new NDWIs will become available when Advanced Land Imager (ALI) data are used as the ALI sensor provides one green band (Band 4), two NIR bands (Bands 6 and 7), and three SWIR bands (Bands 8, 9, and 10). Thus, selecting the optimal band or combination of bands is critical when ALI data are employed to map LSW using NDWI. The purpose of this paper is to find the best performing NDWI model of the ALI data in LSW map. In this study, eleven NDWI models based on ALI, Thematic Mapper (TM), and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data were compared to assess the performance of ALI data in LSW mapping, at three different study sites in the Yangtze River Basin, China. The contrast method, Otsu method, and confusion matrix were calculated to evaluate the accuracies of the LSW maps. The accuracies of LSW maps derived from eleven NDWI models showed that five NDWI models of the ALI sensor have more than an overall accuracy of 91{\%} with a Kappa coefficient of 0.78 of LSW maps at three test sites. In addition, the NDWI model, calculated from the green (Band 4: 0.525?0.605 $\mu$m) and SWIR (Band 9: 1.550?1.750 $\mu$m) bands of the ALI sensor, namely NDWIA4,9, was shown to have the highest LSW mapping accuracy, more than the other NDWI models. Therefore, the NDWIA4,9 is the best indicator for LSW mapping of the ALI sensor. It can be used for mapping LSW with high accuracy.},

  abstract = {Otsu reference proposed a criterion for maximizing the between-class variance of pixel intensity to perform picture thresholding. However, Otsu's method for image segmentation is very time-consuming because of the inefficient formulation of the between-class variance. In this paper, a faster version of Otsu's method is proposed for improving the efficiency of computation for the optimal thresholds of an image. First, a criterion for maximizing a modified between-class variance that is equivalent to the criterion of maximizing the usual between-class variance is proposed for image segmen- tation. Next, in accordance with the new criterion, a recursive algorithm is designed to efficiently find the optimal threshold. This procedure yields the same set of thresholds as the original method. In addition, the modified between-class variance can be pre-computed and stored in a look-up table. Our analysis of the new criterion clearly shows that it takes less computation to compute both the cumulative probability (zeroth order moment) and the mean (first order moment) of a class, and that determining the modified between-class variance by accessing a look-up table is quicker than that by performing mathematical arithmetic operations. For example, the experimental results of a five-level threshold selection show that our proposed method can reduce down the processing time from more than one hour by the conventional Otsu's method to less than 107 seconds.},

This paper proves that the objective function of Otsu method is equivalent to that of K-means method in multilevel thresholding . They are both based on a same criterion that minimizes the within-class variance. However, Otsu method is an exhaustive algorithm of searching the global optimal threshold, while K-means is a local optimal method. Moreover, K-means does not require computing a gray-level histogram before running, but Otsu method needs to compute a gray-level histogram firstly. Therefore, K-means can be more efficiently extended to multilevel thresholding method, two-dimensional thresholding method and three-dimensional method than Otsu method. This paper proved that the clustering results of K-means keep the order of the initial centroids with respect to one-dimensional data set. The experiments show that the k-means thresholding method performs well with less computing time than Otsu method does on three dimensional image thresholding.},

  abstract = {Following extreme flooding in eastern Australia in 2011, the Australian Government established a programme to improve access to flood information across Australia. As part of this, a project was undertaken to map the extent of surface water across Australia using the multi-decadal archive of Landsat satellite imagery. A water detection algorithm was used based on a decision tree classifier, and a comparison methodology using a logistic regression. This approach provided an understanding of the confidence in the water observations. The results were used to map the presence of surface water across the entire continent from every observation of 27years of satellite imagery. The Water Observation from Space (WOfS) product provides insight into the behaviour of surface water across Australia through time, demonstrating where water is persistent, such as in reservoirs, and where it is ephemeral, such as on floodplains during a flood. In addition the WOfS product is useful for studies of wetland extent, aquatic species behaviour, hydrological models, land surface process modelling and groundwater recharge. This paper describes the WOfS methodology and shows how similar time-series analyses of nationally significant environmental variables might be conducted at the continental scale.},

This was made possible via an exhaustive mining of the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM. +) archive. A total of 8881 images were processed to create multi-temporal image metrics resulting in 99.6{\%} of the DRC land area covered by cloud-free Landsat observations. To facilitate image compositing, a top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance calibration and image normalization using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) top of canopy (TOC) reflectance data sets were performed. Mapping and change detection was implemented using a classification tree algorithm. The national year 2000 forest cover was estimated to be 159,529.2. thousand hectares, with gross forest cover loss for the last decade totaling 2.3{\%} of forest area. Forest cover loss area increased by 13.8{\%} between the 2000-2005 and 2005-2010 intervals, with the greatest increase occurring within primary humid tropical forests. Forest loss intensity was distributed unevenly and associated with areas of high population density and mining activity. While forest cover loss is comparatively low in protected areas and priority conservation landscapes compared to forests outside of such areas, gross forest cover loss for all nature protection areas increased by 64{\%} over the 2000 to 2005 and 2005 to 2010 intervals. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Landsat 8 extends the remarkable 40. year Landsat record and has enhanced capabilities including new spectral bands in the blue and cirrus cloud-detection portion of the spectrum, two thermal bands, improved sensor signal-to-noise performance and associated improvements in radiometric resolution, and an improved duty cycle that allows collection of a significantly greater number of images per day. This paper introduces the current (2012-2017) Landsat Science Team's efforts to establish an initial understanding of Landsat 8 capabilities and the steps ahead in support of priorities identified by the team. Preliminary evaluation of Landsat 8 capabilities and identification of new science and applications opportunities are described with respect to calibration and radiometric characterization; surface reflectance; surface albedo; surface temperature, evapotranspiration and drought; agriculture; land cover, condition, disturbance and change; fresh and coastal water; and snow and ice. Insights into the development of derived 'higher-level' Landsat products are provided in recognition of the growing need for consistently processed, moderate spatial resolution, large area, long-term terrestrial data records for resource management and for climate and global change studies. The paper concludes with future prospects, emphasizing the opportunities for land imaging constellations by combining Landsat data with data collected from other international sensing systems, and consideration of successor Landsat mission requirements. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

Comparison to forest-change maps derived from uncorrected images showed significant disagreement, ranging from 23{\%} to 45{\%}. Validated against high-resolution (1. m or less) time-serial images, the illumination correction decreased overestimation of forest gains and losses and improved specificity in detection of major forest changes. The overall accuracy increases 34{\%} at the Cherokee Forest site and about 10{\%} at the other three sites. The disagreement rate between change maps from the original and corrected Landsat images increased with increasing terrain inclination angle, with the relationship between illumination condition and the disagreement rate following a V-shaped curve that varied among sites. The lowest disagreement rate occurred when illumination condition was slightly smaller than that of a horizontal field. The correction for topographic illumination should be considered as a standard pre-processing step for land cover classification and land use change detection, especially for mountainous areas. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {A new procedure for the representation of flow directions and calculation of upslope areas using rectangular grid digital elevation models is presented. The procedure is based on representing flow direction as a single angle taken as the steepest downward slope on the eight triangular facets centered at each grid point. Upslope area is then calculated by proportioning flow between two downslope pixels according to how close this flow direction is to the direct angle to the downslope pixel. This procedure offers improvements over prior procedures that have restricted flow to eight possible directions (introducing grid bia) or proportioned flow according to slope (introducing unrealistic dispersion). The new procedure is more robust than prior procedures based on fitting local planes while retaining a simple grid based structure. Detailed algorithms are presented and results are demonstrated through test examples and application to digital elevation data sets.},

The radiance variables evaluated included the red and photographic infrared (IR) radiance and the linear combinations of the IR/red ratio, the square root of the IR/red ratio, the IR-red difference, the vegetation index, and the transformed vegetation index. In addition, the corresponding green and red linear combinations were evaluated for comparative purposes. Three data sets were used from June, September, and October sampling periods. Regression analysis showed the increased utility of the IR and red linear combinations vis-??-vis the same green and red linear combinations. The red and IR linear combinations had 7{\%} and 14{\%} greater regression significance than the green and red linear combinations for the June and September sampling periods, respectively. The vegetation index, transformed vegetation index, and square root of the IR/red ratio were the most significant, followed closely by the IR/red ratio. Less than a 6{\%} difference separated the highest and lowest of these four ER and red linear combinations. The use of these linear combinations was shown to be sensitive primarily to the green leaf area or green leaf biomass. As such, these linear combinations of the red and photographic IR radiances can be employed to monitor the photosynthetically active biomass of plant canopies. ?? 1979.},

The modified NDWI (MNDWI) can enhance open water features while efficiently suppressing and even removing built-up land noise as well as vegetation and soil noise. The enhanced water information using the NDWI is often mixed with built-up land noise and the area of extracted water is thus overestimated. Accordingly, the MNDWI is more suitable for enhancing and extracting water information for a water region with a background dominated by built-up land areas because of its advantage in reducing and even removing built-up land noise over the NDWI.},

  abstract = {River delineation is an initial yet critical step in river studies. Although the analysis of satellite images shows great potential in river delineation, only a few approaches have been developed. These methods usually focus on rivers at mono-scale and may ignore the large variations in river size. In particular, they may fail to capture the small rivers in the imagery. This paper presents a novel automated multi-scale procedure for delineating complete river networks. This method classifies the large and small rivers separately and combines the two classified results to generate the final delineated river networks. First, a modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) is adapted to enhance the spectral contrast between open water and land surfaces. Second, a simple OTSU classification is used to delineate the large rivers. Next, a top-hat transformation and multi-scale matched filters are used to enhance the small linear rivers. Then, the OTSU classification is conducted again to delineate the small linear rivers, in concert with a multi-points fast marching method to rejoin the resulting river segments. Finally, the complete river networks are delineated by combining the small and large rivers. A comparison of this procedure with manual digitization when applied to two Landsat-5 TM images demonstrates the former procedure's value in delineating rivers. It achieves accurate results and outperforms the other three alternative approaches (large river classification, maximum likelihood classifier, and support vector machine classifier) in accuracy, true positive rate, and Kappa coefficient, while also yielding a comparable false positive rate.},

  abstract = {We developed a new algorithm called Tmask (multiTemporal mask) for automated masking of cloud, cloud shadow, and snow for multitemporal Landsat images. This algorithm consists of two steps. The first step is based on a single-date algorithm called Fmask (Function of mask) that initially screens most of the clouds, cloud shadows, and snow. The second step benefits from the extra temporal information from the remaining "clear" pixels and further improves the cloud, cloud shadow, and snow mask. Three Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance bands (Bands 2, 4, and 5 - Landsat-7 band numbering) are used in a Robust Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (RIRLS) method to estimate a time series model for each pixel. By comparing model estimates with Landsat observations for the three spectral bands, the Tmask algorithm is capable of detecting any remaining clouds, cloud shadows, and snow for an entire stack of Landsat images. Generally, this algorithm will not falsely identify land cover changes as clouds, cloud shadows, or snow, as it is capable of modeling land cover change. The multitemporal images also provide extra information for better discrimination of cloud and snow, which is difficult for single-date algorithm. A snow threshold is derived for Band 5 TOA reflectance for each pixel at each specific time based on a modified Norwegian Linear Reflectance-to-Snow-Cover (NLR) algorithm. By comparing the results of Tmask with a single-date algorithm (Fmask) for multitemporal Landsat images located at Path 12 Row 31, significant improvements are observed for identification of clouds, cloud shadows, and snow. The most significant improvement is observed for cloud shadow detection. Many of the errors in cloud, cloud shadow, and snow detection observed in Fmask are corrected by the Tmask algorithm. The goal is development of a cloud, cloud shadow, and snow detection algorithm that results in a multitemporal stack of images that is free of "noise" factors and thus suitable for detection of land cover change. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {A new method called Fmask (Function of mask) for cloud and cloud shadow detection in Landsat imagery is provided. Landsat Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and Brightness Temperature (BT) are used as inputs. Fmask first uses rules based on cloud physical properties to separate Potential Cloud Pixels (PCPs) and clear-sky pixels. Next, a normalized temperature probability, spectral variability probability, and brightness probability are combined to produce a probability mask for clouds over land and water separately. Then, the PCPs and the cloud probability mask are used together to derive the potential cloud layer. The darkening effect of the cloud shadows in the Near Infrared (NIR) Band is used to generate a potential shadow layer by applying the flood-fill transformation. Subsequently, 3D cloud objects are determined via segmentation of the potential cloud layer and assumption of a constant temperature lapse rate within each cloud object. The view angle of the satellite sensor and the illuminating angle are used to predict possible cloud shadow locations and select the one that has the maximum similarity with the potential cloud shadow mask. If the scene has snow, a snow mask is also produced. For a globally distributed set of reference data, the average Fmask overall cloud accuracy is as high as 96.4{\%}. The goal is development of a cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithm suitable for routine usage with Landsat images.},

Here we firstly indicate that the CSD went through high accumulation (1958-1978); slight accumulation (1978-1997), slight erosion (1997-2002); and high accumulation (2002-2009), despite the 70{\%} reduction of the sediment load from upstream since the operation of the TGD in 2003. Meanwhile, at the depocenter of the submerged delta, the accumulation maintained a high rate of 10 cm/yr during 1958-2009. This suggests on a longer term, the distal sediment source from the upstream had little effect on the CSD. Within this time frame the changes in the partition of sediment load among the branching channels of the Changjiang Estuary could likely control the shifting of the depocenter of the CSD on a decadal time scale. Episodic extreme floods and storm surges also increased the magnitude of deposition and erosion of the CSD on short-term scales. A re-evaluation of the impacts of TGD on the CSD is urgently needed.},

  abstract      = {Large dams have been an important component of infrastructure development in capitalist and communist countries alike. In 1998, changing world attitudes on large dams led to a two-year World Commission on Dams and new global standards may soon insist that future projects pay fair compensation so that resettlement becomes voluntary. Now, 10years after introduction of economic reforms, China is mobilizing its resources to build the world's largest dam. This fulfils a longstanding ambition to impound the Yangtze River in Central China at the Three Gorges and use the hydropower, improved navigation and flood control to develop the economy. This paper examines the socio-economic impact of Three Gorges Dam on over 1.3 million people to be displaced while China is in transition to a market economy. We consider resettlement in terms of the decision-making structure, property rights and incentives to move, and how the project exacerbates problems created by market reforms, especially rising unemployment and deteriorating public health. We conclude the project is boosting economic expectations while adversely affecting large sections of the population, and this could provoke widespread social unrest and eventual changes in political institutions.},

Sea-level rise is particularly critical for low-lying carbonate reef-lined atoll islands; these islands have limited land and water available for human habitation, water and food sources, and ecosystems that are vulnerable to inundation from sea-level rise. Here we demonstrate that sea-level rise will result in larger waves and higher wave-driven water levels along atoll islands' shorelines than at present. Numerical model results reveal waves will synergistically interact with sea-level rise, causing twice as much land forecast to be flooded for a given value of sea-level rise than currently predicted by current models that do not take wave-driven water levels into account. Atolls with islands close to the shallow reef crest are more likely to be subjected to greater wave-induced run-up and flooding due to sea-level rise than those with deeper reef crests farther from the islands' shorelines. It appears that many atoll islands will be flooded annually, salinizing the limited freshwater resources and thus likely forcing inhabitants to abandon their islands in decades, not centuries, as previously thought.},

  abstract      = {Fluvial landscapes are dissected by channels, and at their upstream termini are channel heads. Accurate reconstruction of the fluvial domain is fundamental to understanding runoff generation, storm hydrology, sediment transport, biogeochemical cycling, and landscape evolution. Many methods have been proposed for predicting channel head locations using topographic data, yet none have been tested against a robust field data set of mapped channel heads across multiple landscapes. In this study, four methods of channel head prediction were tested against field data from four sites with high-resolution DEMs: slope-area scaling relationships; two techniques based on landscape tangential curvature; and a new method presented here, which identifies the change from channel to hillslope topography along a profile using a transformed longitudinal coordinate system. Our method requires only two user-defined parameters, determined via independent statistical analysis. Slope-area plots are traditionally used to identify the fluvial-hillslope transition, but we observe no clear relationship between this transition and field-mapped channel heads. Of the four methods assessed, one of the tangential curvature methods and our new method most accurately reproduce the measured channel heads in all four field sites (Feather River CA, Mid Bailey Run OH, Indian Creek OH, Piedmont VA), with mean errors of ?{\`{a}}{\'{i}}11, ?{\`{a}}{\'{i}}7, 5, and ?{\`{a}}{\'{i}}24 m and 34, 3, 12, and ?{\`{a}}{\'{i}}58 m, respectively. Negative values indicate channel heads located upslope of those mapped in the field. Importantly, these two independent methods produce mutually consistent estimates, providing two tests of channel head locations based on independent topographic signatures.},

Hence, a key component of channel network growth and landscape evolution theories1-7, as well as models for topographically controlled catch-ment runoff8, should be the prediction of where channels begin. Little field data exist, however, either on channel head locations9-14 or on what processes act to initiate and maintain a channel14-17. Here we report observations from several soil-mantled regions of Oregon and California, which show that the source area above the channel head decreases with increasing local valley gradient for slopes ranging from 5 to 45 degrees. Our results support a predicted relationship between source area and slope for steep humid landscapes where channel initiation is by landsliding, but they contradict theoretical predictions for channel initiation by overland flow in gentle valleys. Our data also suggest that, for the same gradient, drier regions tend to have larger source areas.},

  abstract      = {This paper introduces a new terrain model named HAND, and reports on the calibration and validation of landscape classes representing soil environments in Amazonia, which were derived using it. The HAND model normalizes topography according to the local relative heights found along the drainage network, and in this way, presents the topology of the relative soil gravitational potentials, or local draining potentials. The HAND model has been demonstrated to show a high correlation with the depth of the water table, providing an accurate spatial representation of soil water environments. Normalized draining potentials can be classified according to the relative vertical flowpath-distances to the nearest drainages, defining classes of soil water environments. These classes have been shown to be comparable and have verifiable and reproducible hydrological significance across the studied catchment and for surrounding ungauged catchments. The robust validation of this model over an area of 18,000km2 in the lower Rio Negro catchment has demonstrated its capacity to map expansive environments using only remotely acquired topography data as inputs. The classified HAND model has also preliminarily demonstrated robustness when applied to ungauged catchments elsewhere with contrasting geologies, geomorphologies and soil types. The HAND model and the derived soil water maps can help to advance physically based hydrological models and be applied to a host of disciplines that focus on soil moisture and ground water dynamics. As an original assessment of soil water in the landscape, the HAND model explores the synergy between digital topography data and terrain modeling, presenting an opportunity for solving many difficult problems in hydrology.},

Following this preprocessing, channels are defined as curves of minimal effort, or geodesics, where the effort is measured on the basis of fundamental geomorphological characteristics such as flow accumulation area and isoheight contours curvature. The merits of the proposed methodology, and especially the computational efficiency and accurate localization of the extracted channels, are demonstrated using light detection and ranging (lidar) data of the Skunk Creek, a tributary of the South Fork Eel River basin in northern California.},

  abstract      = {Bedrock river profiles are often interpreted with the aid of slope-area analysis, but noisy topographic data make such interpretations challenging. We present an alternative approach based on an integration of the steady-state form of the stream power equation. The main component of this approach is a transformation of the horizontal coordinate that converts a steady-state river profile into a straight line with a slope that is simply related to the ratio of the uplift rate to the erodibility. The transformed profiles, called chi plots, have other useful properties, including co-linearity of steady-state tributaries with their main stem and the ease of identifying transient erosional signals. We illustrate these applications with analyses of river profiles extracted from digital topographic datasets. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd..},

  abstract      = {Optical imagery can reveal spectral properties of forest canopy, which rarely allows for finding accurate correspondence of canopy features with soils and hydrology. In Amazonia non-floodable swampy forests can not be easily distinguished from non-floodable terra-firme forests using just bidimensional spectral data. Accurate topographic data are required for the understanding of land surface processes at finer scales. Topographic detail has now become available with the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) data. This new digital elevation model (DEM) shows the feature-rich relief of lowland rain forests, adding to the ability to map rain forest environments through many quantitative terrain descriptors. In this paper we report on the development of a new quantitative topographic algorithm, called HAND (Height Above the Nearest Drainage), based on SRTM-DEM data. We tested the HAND descriptor for a groundwater, topographic and vegetation dataset from central Amazonia. The application of the HAND descriptor in terrain classification revealed strong correlation between soil water conditions, like classes of water table depth, and topography. This correlation obeys the physical principle of soil draining potential, or relative vertical distance to drainage, which can be detected remotely through the topography of the vegetation canopy found in the SRTM-DEM data.},

  abstract      = {We produced a landscape scale map of mean tree height in mangrove forests in Everglades National Park (ENP) using the elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The SRTM data was calibrated using airborne lidar data and a high resolution USGS digital elevation model (DEM). The resulting mangrove height map has a mean tree height error of 2.0 m (RMSE) over a pixel of 30 m. In addition, we used field data to derive a relationship between mean forest stand height and biomass in order to map the spatial distribution of standing biomass of mangroves for the entire National Park. The estimation showed that most of the mangrove standing biomass in the ENP resides in intermediate-height mangrove stands around 8 m. We estimated the total mangrove standing biomass in ENP to be 5.6 109 kg. 2006 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.},
