\dropcap{T}{his} thesis explores automated methods of surface water detection from satellite imagery. Multiple existing methods are explored, discussed, and a number of new algorithms are introduced to allow very accurate detection of surface water and surface water changes. The methods range in applicability from local scale to global scale, and from detecting high-frequency changes to low-frequency changes. I also discuss their trade-offs regarding accuracy and applicability of the surface water detection methods. Multiple applications are presented to test new methods, including long-term global surface water change analysis at 30m resolution, generation of a permanent surface water mask for Murray-Darling River Basin in Australia and in-depth validation for a small reservoir in California, USA, used to demonstrate performance of the methods. The algorithms discussed in the thesis are applicable to process both optical multispectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery.
