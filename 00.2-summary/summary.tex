\dropcap{T}{his} thesis studies automated methods of surface water detection from satellite imagery. Multiple existing methods are explored, discussed, and some new algorithms are introduced to allow very accurate detection of surface water and surface water changes. 
\todo{This is a to do note at margin}
The methods range in applicability from local scale to global scale, and from detecting high-frequency changes to low-frequency changes. 
I also discuss their trade-offs regarding accuracy and applicability of the surface water detection methods. Several applications are presented to test the introduced methods. One of the studies focuses on a long-term (30 years) global surface water change detection at 30m resolution. The other one looks at the generation of a permanent surface water mask for Murray-Darling River Basin in Australia. Additionally, an in-depth validation for a small reservoir in California, USA, is presented to demonstrate the performance of the new methods. 
\todo[inline, color=yellow]{This is a simple comment between text} 
The algorithms discussed in the thesis were applied and tested to process both passive optical multispectral and active synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data.
