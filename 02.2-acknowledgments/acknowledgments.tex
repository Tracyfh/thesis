I would like to thanks Deltares, the FP7 European Comission project earth2Observe, and SERVIR-Mekong project for funding the research presented in this thesis. I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors Nick van de Giesen, Elmar Eiseman and Bert Jagers for guiding me throughout this journey and providing constructive feedback as well. Nick, I could not have imagined having a better advisor and mentor for my Ph.D study. I am grateful to my colleagues Hessel Winsemius, Jaap Schellekens, Fedor Baart, Jaap Kwadijk, Joost Icke, Gerard van de Kolff, Arthur Baart for their patience and support in overcoming numerous obstacles I have been facing through my research. I am also grateful to Google for providing Cloud Compute Services credits which helped me to get results faster and of a better quality. Working with the Google Earth Engine community and software engineers was a great pleasure. Noel Gorelick, Nicolas Clinton, Tyler Ericson, Simon Ilyushchenko, Matt Hancher, George Azzari, Guido Lemione, Sam Murphy and many other active participants of the Google Earth Engine Developers Forum - I've leaned a lot from you during sleepless nights of my journey. Sometimes, questions on the forum get answered in less than a minute - that was very helpful and has motivated me a lot! I also would like to thank my friends and family for supporting me spiritually throughout writing this thesis.
